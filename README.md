# TermCon

When we started the Python course, I asked my teacher what the end project would be. He said we would build our own Telnet-like client and server using sockets. So I threw myself at it and finished it a few weeks into the course.


# Server Setup

Step 1. 

Download the project on the server ```git clone https://github.com/Ejo2001/Guestbook.git```

Step 2.

Install Python ```sudo apt install python3.9```  

Step 3. 

Run it ```python3 /path/to/Server.py```


You can change port in the script on line 11. Customize it to your liking. Remember that to open up the port on the router to access it from the internet (Not recommended)
 
# Client Setup

Step 1. 

Download the project on the client ```git clone https://github.com/Ejo2001/Guestbook.git```

Step 2.

Install Python ```sudo apt install python3.9```  

Step 3. 

Run it ```python3 /path/to/Client.py```

Step 4.
