# TermCon

When we started the Python course, I asked my teacher what the end project would be. He said we would build our own Telnet-like client and server using sockets. So I threw myself at it and finished it a few weeks into the course. This program is not intended for profesional use. It has a bunch of flaws, such as not being able to interact with commands that requries passwords etc.

You can change port in the script on line 11. Customize it to your liking. Remember that to open up the port on the router to access it from the internet (Not recommended).
